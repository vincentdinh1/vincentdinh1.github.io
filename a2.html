    <h1>Vincent Dinh's Assignment 2!</h1>
    <h2>Circtui Design</h2>
    <p>Here is the circuit design for assignment 2</p>

    <img src="a2circuit.PNG" />
    <br>
    <p>This circuit is controlled by the button. When the button is pressed, the blue LED will begin fading while the two other LED's stay on.
      In this circuit, the button uses a 10k Ohm resistor, being powered on by pin3. The green LED's are connected to a 220 ohm resistor and powered
      by pin 7/8. The blue LED is connected to a 100 ohm resistor and powered by pin 9.

    <h2>Code</h2>
    <br>
    <br />
    <p>Below is the code used for this assignment:</p>
    <pre><code>
    // constants won't change. They're used here to set pin numbers:
    const int buttonPin = 3;  // the number of the pushbutton pin
    const int greenPin1 = 7;    // the number of the LED(green1) pin
    const int greenPin2 = 8; // the number of the LED(green2) pin
    const int bluePin = 9; // the number of the LED(blue) pin
    
    // variables will change:
    int buttonState = 0;          // variable for reading the pushbutton status
    int lastButtonState = LOW;    // variable to store the last button state
    bool isFading = false;  
    
    void setup() {
      // initialize the LED pins as an output:
      pinMode(greenPin1, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(greenPin1, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(bluePin, OUTPUT);
      // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
      pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
    }
    
    void loop() {
      // read the current state of the button
      buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
    
      // check if the button state has changed (toggle behavior)
      if (buttonState == HIGH && lastButtonState == LOW) {
        isFading = !isFading;  // toggle fading state
        delay(50);             // debounce delay
      }
    
      // store the current button state 
      lastButtonState = buttonState;
    
      if (isFading) {
        // looping for fading in (getting brighter)
        for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
          analogWrite(bluePin, brightness);  // gradually increase brightness
          delay(10);                         // small delay for smooth fading
        }
        // looping for fading out (getting dimmer)
        for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
          analogWrite(bluePin, brightness);  // gradually decrease brightness
          delay(10);                         // small delay for smooth fading
        }
        // green LEDs stay on 
        digitalWrite(greenPin1, HIGH);
        digitalWrite(greenPin2, HIGH);
      } else {
        // Turn off the blue LED and keep the green LEDs solid
        analogWrite(bluePin, 0);
        digitalWrite(greenPin1, HIGH);  // steady ON state for green LEDs
        digitalWrite(greenPin2, HIGH);
      }
    }
    </code></pre>

<h2>Additional Questions:</h2>
<p>1. Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with
  analogWrite(led, 65), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led, 255).

<p>2. Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</p>
<br>
<p>Answer: ~ 32 hours</p>
