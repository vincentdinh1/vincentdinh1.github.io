    <h1>Vincent Dinh's Assignment 3!</h1>
    <h2>Circuit Design</h2>
    <p>Here is the circuit design for assignment 3</p>

    <img src="a3circuitimg.jpg" />
    <br>
    <p>This circuit is controlled by a photoresistor. When the photoresistor is in the dark, the blue LED will be on and the RED LED will be off. 
      When the photoresistor is in the light, the blue LED will be off and the RED LED will be off.
      In this circuit, the photoresistor is connected to pin A0 and uses a 10k Ohm resistor. The blue LED is connected to a 100 ohm resistor and powered
      by pin 11. The RED LED is connected to a 220 ohm resistor and powered by pin 6. Below is the calculations for each of the resistors
    </p>

    <h2>Code</h2>
    <br>
    <br />
    <p>Below is the code used for this assignment:</p>
    <pre><code>
      int sensorValue = 0; // initializing the value for the sensor
      int outputValue = 0; // initializing the value for the output LED (BLUE)
      int redLED = LOW; // initiliazing the red output LED to be off
      
      
      void setup() {
        // put your setup code here, to run once:
        Serial.begin(9600);
        pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // setting the pin 11 (blue led) to be the output
        pinMode(6, OUTPUT); // setting the pin 6 (red LED) to be the output
      }
      
      void loop() {
        // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
          sensorValue = analogRead(A0); // gathering input from the photoresistor 
      
          if (sensorValue > 350) { // if the sensor reads more than 350 it will go into this if statment
            outputValue = map(sensorValue, 350, 1023, 250, 0);  // basically translating to how much light is being aborbed from the sensor, it will provide the duty cycle for the LED
            analogWrite(11, outputValue); // when there is significant light, the blue Led will turn on 
      
            analogWrite(6, LOW); // the red LED will stay off when it's currently meeting the conditions of the sensor value
            redLED = LOW;
      
          } else { // if it doesn't meet that threshold, then automatically the blue led will turn off and the red one will turn on 
            analogWrite(11, 0);
            analogWrite(6, HIGH);
            redLED = HIGH;
          }
      
          Serial.print("Sensor input: "); // reading how much light we are getting from the photoresistor
          Serial.println(sensorValue);
      
          Serial.print("LED Blue: "); // reading how much output the blue LED is getting 
          Serial.println(outputValue);
      
          if (redLED == HIGH) { // determining whether the Red LED is on or off. 
            Serial.println("LED Red: ON");  
          } else {
            Serial.println("LED Red: OFF");
          }
      
          Serial.println("");
          delay(150);
      }
      
    </code></pre>

<h2>Circuit Operation</h2>
<p>Below is a GIF of the circuit operation along with the serial monitor:</p>

<h2>Additional Questions:</h2>
<p>1. In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be 
  one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.

<p>2. Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif</p>

<br>

<p>3. AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 
  16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Answer: It would change my map code by changing my analogWrite from 0-255 to 0 1023
    As well as my analogRead from 0 - 1023 to 0-65545. In turn what this does is increase the mapping to a higher resolution. This would provide smoother transitions for LED fading. This would also provide more accuracy.</p>
