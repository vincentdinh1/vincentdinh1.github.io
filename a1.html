    <h1>Vincent's Assignment 1!</h1>
    <h2>Schemetatic Design</h2>
    <p>Here is the schematics for assignment 1</p>

    <img src="schematics.png" />
    <br>
    <p>This schematics follows based off a parrallel circuit. This would allow each LED to 
      blink independently.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Circuit</h2>
    <img src="circuita1.png" />
    <br>
    <p>Here is the circuit for assignment 1. In this circuit, we are using a 220 ohm resistor. 
      This was calculated by taking our voltage (5v) and subtracting the voltage of the LED (1.8) to get 3.8V
      With the mA being 20 for the LED, it required 190 ohms. In our toolkit the resistor was 220 ohms and was
      appropriate for our circuit.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <br>
    <br />
    <p>Below is the code used for this assignment:</p>
    <pre><code>
const int LED13 = 13; // Initializing the LED light on pin 13 on the Arduino Board
const int LED12 = 12; // Initializing the LED light on pin 12 on the Arduino Board
const int LED4 = 4;   // Initializing the LED light on pin 4 on the Arduino Board

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED13, OUTPUT); // Sets the pin to behave as output pin for pin 13
  pinMode(LED12, OUTPUT); // Sets the pin to behave as output pin for pin 12
  pinMode(LED4, OUTPUT);  // Sets the pin to behave as output pin for pin 4
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED13, HIGH);  // Turning the first LED light on
  delay(800);                 // Will wait for 800 milliseconds while on
  digitalWrite(LED13, LOW);   // Turns off the LED light
  delay(100);                 // Waits for 100 milliseconds
  
  digitalWrite(LED12, HIGH);  // Turning the second LED light on
  delay(250);                 // Will wait for 250 milliseconds while on
  digitalWrite(LED12, LOW);   // Turns off the LED light
  delay(250);                 // Waits for 250 milliseconds
  
  digitalWrite(LED4, HIGH);   // Turning the third LED light on
  delay(1000);                // Will wait for 1000 milliseconds while on
  digitalWrite(LED4, LOW);    // Turns off the LED light
  delay(1000);                // Waits for 1000 milliseconds
}
    </code></pre>

<h2>Additional Questions:</h2>
<p>1. Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LED's Draw a line for each of your 3 LED's</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>2. How many LED's could you blink independently with you Arduino? How much current would that draw?</p>
<br>
<p>Answer: 10 LED's could be blinked independently with the Arduino. The current would be 200 mA</p>
<br>

<p>3. How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</p>
<br>
<p>Answer: 10ms</p>
